        <h3>I love to learn.</h3>
        <p>
          As I have to be aware of changes in either back-end or front-end technologies, learning is a part of my life.<br>
          Learning is a powerful skill, and since it's a skill, it has to be trained every single day.
          I like to follow courses/podcasts on how to learn faster and how to improve your brain.<br>

        <h3>I love sociology.</h3>
        <p>
          I have not the time to study it yet, but I'm fond of studying people's behaviour.<br>
          If you know the people you work with, you can get the maximum potential out of them.
